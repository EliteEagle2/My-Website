                <h2>My Interests</h2>
                <p>My main interest is coding. I love to code and create new things. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.</p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about coding because it allows me to solve problems and bring my ideas to life.<br>
                    I enjoy exploring different programming languages like Python, Java, C#, Visual Basic, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
                    I also like experimenting with databases such as SQL and MongoDB to build dynamic projects.<br>
                    Learning new technologies and improving my coding skills is something I find truly exciting.
                </p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, going to church, and spending time with my family and friends.</p>
                <p>I also have interests in playing guitar in my church's worship band.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my website! I hope you enjoy learning more about me and my work.</p>
