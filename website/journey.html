                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>My journey in technology has been both exciting and transformative. From a young age, I was captivated by video games, which sparked my curiosity about how computers work.</p>
                <p>In elementary and middle school, I was introduced to programming through Scratch, where I quickly discovered a passion and aptitude for coding.</p>
                <p>Before eighth grade, I began exploring hardware by tinkering with my grandfatherâ€™s old PC, learning about the components and how they fit together.</p>
                <p>Entering high school, I received my first gaming PC, which further fueled my interest in both gaming and technology.</p>
                <p>In tenth grade, I enrolled in a vocational technology program focused on computer programming, where my enthusiasm for software development truly flourished.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I upgraded and customized my PC, gaining hands-on experience in building and maintaining computer systems.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am pursuing a degree in software development at college, continuing to expand my skills and knowledge.</p>
                <p>Building this website is a milestone for me, showcasing how far I have come and how much I have learned.</p>
                <p>I am excited for the future and eager to see where my passion for technology will take me next.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my website! I hope you enjoy learning more about me and my work.</p>
