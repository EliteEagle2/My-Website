                <h2>My Work</h2>
                <p>I have developed a range of projects utilizing various programming languages and technologies. My experience includes building responsive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as creating desktop applications using Java and C#.</p>
                <p>During my time at a vocational technical school, I completed annual projects such as order management applications in different programming languages.<br>I also participated in the KodeKlash competition each year, where I designed and developed projects-many of which were games. Notably, I earned second place for creating a board game that featured interactive dice mechanics.</p>
                <p>In addition to software development, I have hands-on experience with database management systems including SQL and MongoDB.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am enhancing my skills in web development by building and maintaining this website. I am always eager to take on new projects and explore emerging technologies.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To view my projects and code repositories, please visit my GitHub profile by clicking "My Github" in the navigation menu above.</p>
